It seems all you do is wait and wait.
Airports are a necessary part of our lives now, as airtravel has become a mainstay in culture and business. With increasing domestic flight departures and increased customers, airline passengers are on average spending 19% more time waiting for taxiing and takeoff. Some airports report an average wait time of 23-25 minutes between pushback and takeoff.

Despite this obviously increasing factor, a large number of domestic flights occur each year, and as expected, the amount is growing.
