It seems all you do is wait and wait.
Airports are a necessary part of our lives now, as airtravel has become a mainstay in culture and business. With increasing domestic flight departures and increased customers, airline passengers are on average spending 19% more time waiting for taxiing and takeoff. Some airports report an average wait time of 23-25 minutes between pushback and takeoff.

Despite this annoying factor, a large number of domestic flights occur each year, and as expected, the amount is growing. How many flights and passengers are actually travelling domestically?

Using data from the <a href="http://academictorrents.com/details/a2ccf94bbb4af222bf8e69dad60a68a29f310d9a">US Census Bureau</a> about US Domestic Flights between 1990 and 2009, I explored overall trends in flight data, as well as the specific effect of the events of September 11, 2001.

The questions I set out to answer seemed relatively easy to acquire, namely: <i>How was airtravel affected by the events of 9/11?
Were total passenger and flight amounts curtailed in the aftermath of September 11? Which cities were the most affected?</i>

While the data was extensive and complete, it was also quite challenging to manipulate to yield usable results. Filtering the data by date while still preserving the other datapoints was extremely challenging, requiring the help of many hands. <font size=3><i>(shoutout to Brandon Mulas, Jacob Padgett, and Dustin Stringer for the help!)</i></font>
